# localChat
A simple, 2-person chat program that runs on a single computer. No Internet, just you.

## Simple and Local
This was created with ease of use in mind. You pick the names of the users, and the name of the chat log. After that, it's a bare-bones chat application that's simple to use. Type 1 or 2 to switch who's talking, and q to quit. Hit enter to send messages. There's only one computer using localChat: yours. It will never connect to the Internet, and you can't chat with someone on the other side of the world with it. This is your chat program, and yours alone.

## Self-talk
localChat was intended for folks that need to talk to the voices within them for one reason or another. Maybe you think better when you talk to yourself. Maybe you're a system and need to have a conversation externally. Maybe it's a handy tool for simulating social interactions ahead of time. Maybe you need a tool for roleplay, or want to write as though your characters were in a chat room. Maybe you just want to mess around. Whatever the reason, localChat was made to let you have that conversation.

## Dependencies and Usage
All you need to have installed is Python 3. 

To run localChat, navigate to the folder you saved it to and open a console there. Type ``python localChat.py`` and you're good to go. If you'd like, you could make a shortcut to the file so that you don't need to do this manually every time. If you're on Linux, you could chuck it in .local/bin to make it easier for you to execute.
